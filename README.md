# Advent of Code

Solutions for all of my solved Advent of Code problems.

## What languages are in here?

Whatever I've solved them in! There's some C# and Python when this README was made, but there may be Rust or even other languages in later commits!

## Why not multiple repos?

Why multiple repos? It's personal preference, and I like having all of my solutions in one place. All of the code is (relatively) small, and it means I don't have to set up a new repository every year. I can just point people at the same repo year after year for solutions.

## Why are these not optimized?

These are built on readability, not speed/golf. I'd rather have usable examples that others can reference than magical golf code that is unreadable.

## What are the requirements?

If you want to use `get_input.py`, you just need the `requests` library. Otherwise, there are no additional requirements!

## How do I get my Advent of Code session cookie for `get_input.py`?

1. Go to <https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1/input>

3. Refresh
